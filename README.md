# Bayesian-Probability


 """
    A Bayesian system for detecting tumors in medical scan images.
    
    Real-world scenario: A hospital's radiology department uses AI-assisted
    diagnosis to help radiologists identify potential tumors in CT scans,
    MRI scans, and X-rays. The system combines multiple imaging indicators
    with patient risk factors using Bayesian inference.
